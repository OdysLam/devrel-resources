# DevRel ü•ë Resources

This a personal repository of resources that I come by in my journey in Developer Relations.

As I was saving them for personal reference, I figured that they could be beneficial to other people as well.

If you feel that something is missing, please do make a PR. As this repository grows, we will probably have to rethink the structure, but for the time being, this README is cool‚úåÔ∏è.
