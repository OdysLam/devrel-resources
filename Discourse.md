# DevRel Collective Discourse Tips

### Tips

- If you want your company (teammates, colleagues, etc.) to be active on the Discourse, make sure they can see the activity that happens there without having to visit (which they won't until it becomes a habit). An easy way to do that is to pipe Discourse topics into a Slack channel that anyone in the company can join, and then see if anything comes up that they could provide a response to. To go a step further, create some fun incentives inside the company for interacting with the community on the Discourse, like a special sticker or t-shirt.
